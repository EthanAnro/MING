The lack of systemic symptoms helps rule out infection or other systemic diseases. Allergic rhinitis is often treated symptomatically with medications that relieve the congestion and other related symptoms. An alpha-adrenergic agonist, such as pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine, is commonly used in such conditions because it causes vasoconstriction of the nasal mucosa blood vessels, which leads to a decrease in congestion. This mechanism differs from the action of antihistamines (which block histamine receptors), muscarinic receptor blockers (which affect parasympathetic signaling), disulfide bond disruptors (which affect mucous viscosity), and beta-2 agonists (which are more commonly used to relieve bronchospasms in conditions such as asthma). Therefore, the alpha-adrenergic agonist's primary mechanism relevant here is vasoconstriction in nasal passages to alleviate symptoms.", "human_checked": 1, "human_check_passed": 1}

The previous history of severe meningoencephalitis and hallucinations are not current issues and don't seem to be related to the mood symptoms. Bipolar II disorder is identified by patterns of depressive and hypomanic episodes, but not full-blown manic episodes which might be seen with Bipolar I disorder.

Additionally, the patient's history of major depression with psychotic features and the significant life stressor of his wife's death may further elevate risk, but the actual attempt he made three years ago is the most critical red flag for future suicide risk.

{"question": "Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.\nMethods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.\nResults: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.\nConclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.\nIf the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify?", "answer": "Measurement bias", "options": {"A": "Measurement bias", "B": "Recall bias", "C": "Lead-time bias", "D": "Selection bias"}, "meta_info": "step2&3", "answer_idx": "A", "metamap_phrases": ["Background", "lack", "consensus", "initial imaging method", "patients", "suspected nephrolithiasis", "computed tomography", "ultrasonography", "Methods", "multicenter", "pragmatic", "effectiveness trial", "assigned patients", "76 years", "age", "presented", "emergency department", "suspected nephrolithiasis to", "initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by", "emergency physician", "point-of-care ultrasonography", "ultrasonography performed by", "radiologist", "radiology ultrasonography", "abdominal non contrast CT", "Subsequent management", "including additional imaging", "physician", "compared", "three groups", "day incidence of high-risk diagnoses", "complications", "related", "missed", "delayed diagnosis", "month cumulative radiation", "Secondary outcomes", "serious adverse events", "related serious adverse events", "attributable to study participation", "pain", "assessed", "point visual-analog scale", "higher scores", "more severe pain", "return emergency department visits", "hospitalizations", "diagnostic accuracy", "Results", "total", "patients", "randomization", "point-of-care ultrasonography", "radiology ultrasonography", "non contrast", "incidence of high-risk diagnoses", "complications", "first 30 days", "low", "0.4", "not", "according", "imaging method", "mean", "month cumulative radiation", "lower", "ultrasonography groups", "CT group", "p", "0.001", "Serious adverse events occurred", "12.4", "patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography", "10.8", "assigned", "radiology ultrasonography", "assigned", "CT", "p", "0 50", "Related adverse events", "infrequent", "incidence", "0.4", "similar", "groups", "7 days", "average pain score", "2", "group", "p", "0 84", "Return emergency department visits", "hospitalizations", "diagnostic accuracy", "not", "groups", "Conclusions", "Initial ultrasonography", "associated with lower cumulative radiation", "initial CT", "significant differences", "high-risk diagnoses", "complications", "serious adverse events", "pain scores", "return emergency department visits", "hospitalizations", "conclusion stated", "due to", "earlier detection", "nephrolithiasis", "patients", "point of care ultrasound", "type", "bias"], "rationale": "The answer provided (A) indicates Measurement bias.

Rifampin is a potent inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP3A4. Oral contraceptives rely on adequate levels of hormones such as ethinylestradiol and progesterone to be effective. When CYP3A4 is induced, it increases the metabolism of these hormones, leading to decreased serum levels. This reduction in hormone levels can fall below the threshold necessary to prevent ovulation, resulting in contraceptive failure, as likely occurred in this patient.

Such anemia is often due to a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate, both of which are critical in DNA synthesis. Since DNA synthesis requires adequate production of nitrogenous bases (specifically purines and pyrimidines), a deficiency here can result in ineffective erythropoiesis and the megaloblastic characteristics observed on the blood smear. Her recent medication change could have included drugs affecting folate metabolism (e.g., methotrexate), which is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and could have exacerbated an underlying deficiency. Hence, deficient nitrogenous base production (Option C) is the most likely cause of this patient's findings.

One key pathway in the pathogenesis of colon cancer, especially adenomatous polyps, is the Wnt signaling pathway, where β-catenin plays a central role. In normal cells, β-catenin is degraded by the proteasome. However, mutations in proteins like APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) can lead to impaired β-catenin degradation, resulting in its accumulation and the activation of transcription factors that promote cell proliferation.

Which of the following statements is the best explanation for the increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group?\"\n\"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma\nIntroduction:\nActive asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.\nMethods:\nIn this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.\nPatients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.\nAnalyses were performed from baseline to month 12.\nResults:\nAt baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up.

It has several physiological actions that collectively aim to reduce blood volume and blood pressure. Consequently, this peptide would not increase water reabsorption or promote vasoconstriction, thereby excluding options A and B.The experimental analog of ANP would be expected to mimic the actions of natural ANP. Its effects include increasing the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by dilating afferent arterioles and thereby enhancing the excretion of sodium and water (natriuresis and diuresis). ANP also inhibits the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, reducing the release of aldosterone, which leads to decreased sodium and water reabsorption by the kidneys. Additionally, ANP causes vasodilation of the vascular smooth muscle, which can further decrease blood pressure. Therefore, option C is the most accurate description of what the patient might experience. Option D is incorrect, as ANP does not directly affect calcium or phosphate homeostasis significantly.", "human_checked": 0, "human_check_passed": 0}

However, the most relevant action of digoxin in the context of AF and rate control (not rhythm conversion) is its ability to increase vagal tone. Vagal stimulation slows conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node, thereby decreasing the ventricular rate, which explains the patient's heart rate going down to 85/min while staying irregular.

However, knowing that the metabolism isn't variable and can be extrapolated, we assume clearance is standard across patients and tied closely to the half-life. We use the fact that at steady state, the rate of drug input (dose/timing) equals the rate of drug elimination (clearance*Css).MD = Css * Vd * (ln(2)/t1/2) / FBecause the dose frequency (τ) is 8 hours (three half-lives) and half-life is 2 hours, the equation simplifies:MD = Css * Vd * (ln(2)/(t1/2/τ)) / FSubstitute the known values:MD = 15 mg/L * 14.3 L * (ln(2)/(2/8)) / 0.5MD = 15 * 14.3 * (ln(2)/0.25) / 0.5After resolving the equation, the approximate MD is around 1200 mg.Therefore, the appropriate option is C. 1200 milligrams.

In a normal distribution, approximately 68% of values fall within one standard deviation, 95% within two, and over 99% within three.

The fact that she is still oriented to person and time suggests that this is not a longstanding cognitive decline as seen in Alzheimer dementia. Her increased urinary urgency and episodes of incontinence could be attributed to the urinary symptoms sometimes associated with delirium. Additionally, the new medications for anxiety started a month ago could have precipitated or exacerbated the delirium, as elderly patients are particularly sensitive to medications with psychoactive properties.

This occurs when early detection through screening appears to prolong survival because the diagnosis is made earlier in the disease's natural history, even if the actual duration of life from the onset of the disease remains unchanged. By using mortality rates instead of survival rates, one directly measures the impact of the screening on death rates, which is not artificially prolonged by earlier diagnosis.

The clinical picture provided, including poor weight gain with good appetite, frequent stools with unpleasant smell, and a high sweat chloride concentration is highly suggestive of cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, leading to dysfunctional CFTR protein that affects chloride and water transport across epithelial surfaces, particularly in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. This results in thick mucus that can obstruct airways and glands, leading to pulmonary infections (as indicated by the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and malabsorption issues manifesting as failure to thrive and foul-smelling stools.

In an AIDS patient with a CD4+ count lower than 50/mm³, MAC prophylaxis is recommended, usually with azithromycin or clarithromycin. If treatment is required, as in this symptomatic patient, a combination of azithromycin and ethambutol is the appropriate initial therapy. The small induration of the PPD skin test is less relevant as it does not rule out tuberculosis, but tuberculosis generally requires a different treatment approach. Voriconazole is an antifungal drug primarily used for invasive aspergillosis, and Amphotericin B, often with itraconazole, is a treatment for various systemic fungal infections.

The patient rates the 4 points out of 10 on a visual scale. The headache is not accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, and is not aggravated by movements, but gets worse when the patient coughs or laughs. The headache has persisted throughout the day and is usually worse in the morning an hour after she has breakfast and taken her medications. The patient was diagnosed with stage 1 arterial hypertension 2 years ago and stable angina pectoris 3 weeks ago. Currently, she takes aspirin (81 mg once daily), rosuvastatin (10 mg once daily), lisinopril (20 mg once daily), and isosorbide mononitrate (60 mg once daily). She has been menopausal for the last 15 years. In addition to her chief complaint, she also notes that she had a runny nose with a temperature elevation approximately 3 weeks ago, and her headache was linked to that acute illness. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 135/80 mm Hg, heart rate 76/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and temperature 36.5℃ (97.7℉). The physical examination reveals S2 accentuation that is best heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border. Palpation of the paranasal sinuses is painless.

The finding most consistent with recurrent thrombosis in a young patient who has an inherited condition, and without other risk factors, is resistance to clotting factor degradation, specifically activated protein C resistance. This is commonly caused by the Factor V Leiden mutation, which results in a poor anticoagulant response to activated protein C and an increased risk for thrombosis. Elevated homocysteine (A) is a risk factor for arterial and venous thrombosis, but it does not directly fit with the pattern of recurrent DVTs. Thrombin inhibitor deficiency (B) and auto-antibodies directed against phospholipids (C), as seen in antiphospholipid syndrome, can also lead to thrombosis, but Factor V Leiden is more likely given her demographic and the recurrent nature of the thrombosis without other features of antiphospholipid syndrome like pregnancy morbidity or a history of arterial thrombosis.", "human_checked": 0, "human_check_passed": 0}

This scenario prompts the kidneys to retain sodium and water in an attempt to increase circulating blood volume and improve cardiac output. Therefore, the increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption (option D) is a compensatory mechanism associated with CHF. Decreased GFR (option A) could also be a result but is not directly associated with the symptoms. Options B and C are unlikely given the signs of fluid overload, not decreased ECF or improved renal blood flow.", "human_checked": 1, "human_check_passed": 1}

Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is unlikely given the age of the patient and the intermittent nature of the symptoms, as this condition typically presents in younger infants with persistent symptoms. Pancreas divisum is a congenital condition where the pancreatic ducts fail to fuse and can lead to recurrent episodes of abdominal pain due to the pancreatic ductal system's inefficient drainage.

Tolterodine is an antimuscarinic agent which helps to relax the detrusor muscle, thereby reducing the urgency and frequency of urination. Midodrine (A) is used for orthostatic hypotension, rivastigmine (B) for dementia, particularly in Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease, and mirtazapine (C) is an antidepressant, none of which are appropriate for treating urinary incontinence.

The elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit could be explained by chronic exposure to decreased oxygen levels, prompting the body to produce more red blood cells in an effort to improve oxygen delivery. Chronic exposure to CO, which has a high affinity for hemoglobin, would reduce the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood, inducing a compensatory erythrocytosis.

Paraneoplastic syndromes can cause a wide range of symptoms including weakness and weight loss, which are seen in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), often associated with small cell lung cancer. Bladder incontinence can also be associated with autonomic nervous system dysfunction seen in LEMS. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked disorder affecting boys.

Infants have immature immune systems that handle polysaccharides poorly, resulting in weak T-cell independent immune responses and predominantly IgM type antibodies, which are not as effective. The conjugation process transforms the response to these polysaccharides into a T-cell dependent one, which facilitates the production of IgG antibodies - the more effective and long-lasting type for defense against invasive pathogens. It significantly improves the immunogenicity of the vaccine, thereby providing more effective protection to infants, who are at higher risk for invasive bacterial diseases caused by agents such as Hib.", "human_checked": 0, "human_check_passed": 0}

For toxicity, we look at the dose just before serious adverse events become common. With the 60 mg dose, 15/42 patients experienced adverse events; this is becoming less manageable and could be considered toxic.The therapeutic index (TI) can be estimated as:TI = TD50 (Toxic Dose for 50% of population) / ED50 (Effective Dose for 50% of population)From the given data, the ED50 can be approximated around the 40 mg dose. The TD50 is less clear but may be assumed to be just above the 40 mg dose — possibly between 40 and 60 mg since toxicity jumps significantly at 60 mg.The closest doses with response rates above and below 50% are 40 mg for efficacy and somewhere above 40 mg for toxicity. Since we do not have an exact TD50, we can approximate using the given data and determine that the therapeutic index will be above 1.0 (since the effective dose has fewer adverse effects than the toxic dose).

Yolk sac tumor, also known as endodermal sinus tumor. This diagnosis is supported by the elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level of 350 ng/mL, which is significantly higher than the normal value. Yolk sac tumors are known to secrete AFP, and such a high level is commonly associated with these tumors in children. The human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level is within the normal range, which is not typically elevated in yolk sac tumors and helps rule out choriocarcinoma, as hCG would be expected to be high in this type of tumor. Additionally, the biopsy findings describe structures that resemble glomeruli with a central capillary, which is characteristic of Schiller-Duval bodies unique to yolk sac tumors. Classic seminoma and teratoma do not commonly present with elevated AFP or these histological features in children.", "human_checked": 1, "human_check_passed": 1}
{"question": "A 15-year-old girl comes to the physician because she has not had menstrual bleeding for the past 3 months. Menses had previously occurred at irregular 15–45 day intervals with moderate to heavy flow. Menarche was at the age of 14 years.

Anovulation. The patient's irregular menstrual cycles prior to amenorrhea, history of having recently initiated sexual activity, absence of menses, normal appearance of vagina and cervix on pelvic examination, and normal serum hormone levels except for a low progesterone level indicative of a lack of ovulation, all suggest anovulation as the primary issue. Additionally, the patient's history of risperidone use could contribute to menstrual irregularities due to hyperprolactinemia, however, her prolactin levels are normal. Her familial history indicates a potential hormonal component (mother with PCOS and a diabetic father), but given her normal testosterone levels and the absence of other PCOS symptoms, this is less likely the cause. Uterine fibroids (A) and Mullerian ducts defects (B) are unlikely due to findings of a normal pelvic exam and the recent nature of amenorrhea. Purging behavior (C) might lead to amenorrhea through severe weight loss, but her BMI does not indicate a severe eating disorder.", "human_checked": 0, "human_check_passed": 0}
{"question": "A 30-year-old female presents to her primary care provider complaining of 4 days of fever, malaise, dyspnea, and productive cough and has recently developed pleuritic chest pain. Her past medical history is notable for asthma and takes albuterol as needed. She does not smoke but drinks alcohol socially. Her family history is notable for cystic fibrosis in her paternal uncle and interstitial lung disease in her paternal grandfather. Her temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 115/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 21/min. Rales are noted in the right lower lung, and a chest radiograph demonstrates focal consolidation in the right lower lung lobe. After initiating the appropriate treatment, she agrees to take part in a study assessing the immune response to lung infections. A protein is identified in her serum that is thought to be elevated in response to her condition. An amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus of the protein is isolated and a fluorescent marker is added to the sequence. This labeled sequence is subsequently added to a gel containing a protein isolated from the cell surface of the patient’s own neutrophils and macrophages and subsequently labeled with another fluorescent marker. The sequence binds strongly to this protein as evidenced by increased fluorescence in the gel.

Isotype switching. The scenario suggests that the identified protein is likely an antibody, given that antibodies mediate responses to lung infections and have variable amino acid sequences that confer specificity to antigens. The presence of fever, malaise, productive cough, and consolidation are indicative of a bacterial infection, potentially triggering an immune response. Isotype switching, also known as class switching, occurs in B cells after exposure to an antigen and is the process whereby a B cell changes the antibody class it produces (e.g., from IgM to IgG) without altering the antigen specificity. This process involves interaction between antibodies and various cells including neutrophils and macrophages, as implied by the experiment's results. Other options, such as V(D)J recombination, occur during early B-cell development, not in response to an active infection. Random assortment and random nucleotide addition are not processes typically associated with immune responses to infections; they are more related to genetic diversity in receptors.", "human_checked": 0, "human_check_passed": 0}
{"question": "A 21-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his mother after being found lying unconscious next to a bottle of pills. The patient’s mother mentions that he has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder 3 years ago for which he was taking a medication that resulted in only a slight improvement in his symptoms. She says he still found it difficult to concentrate on his studies and did not participate in any social events in college. He didn’t have many friends and was often found sitting alone in his room. He has also threatened to take his life on several occasions, but she did not think he was serious. While recording his vital signs, the patient goes into a coma.

The ECG showing a QT interval of 450 milliseconds is indicative of clomipramine's known side effect of QT prolongation, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and coma in overdose situations. Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), and TCAs are notorious for their cardiotoxicity in overdoses. Additional information supporting this includes the patient's history of major depressive disorder, poor response to previous medication likely leading to continued use or increased dosage of a potent TCA like clomipramine, social withdrawal, and previously voiced threats of suicide, suggesting intentional overdose as a possibility. Other medications listed are less likely to cause such a significant QT prolongation or are less commonly associated with fatal overdoses.", "human_checked": 1, "human_check_passed": 1}
